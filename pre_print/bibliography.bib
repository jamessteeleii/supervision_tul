  abstract = {Explosive movements requiring high force and power outputs are integral to many sports, posing distinct challenges for the neuromuscular system. Traditional resistance training can improve muscle strength, power, endurance, and range of motion; however, evidence regarding its effects on athletic performance, such as sprint speed, agility, and jump height, remains conflicting. The specificity of resistance training movements, including velocity, contraction type, and joint angles affects performance outcomes, demonstrates advantages when matching training modalities with targeted sports activities. However, independent of movement speed, the intent to contract explosively (ballistic) has also demonstrated high velocity-specific training adaptations. The purpose of this narrative review was to assess the impact of explosive or ballistic contraction intent on velocity-specific training adaptations. Such movement intent may predominantly elicit motor efferent neural adaptations, including motor unit recruitment and rate coding enhancements. Plyometrics, which utilize rapid stretch-shortening cycle movements, may augment high-speed movement efficiency and muscle activation, possibly leading to improved motor control through adaptations like faster eccentric force absorption, reduced amortization periods, and quicker transitions to explosive concentric contractions. An optimal training paradigm for power and performance enhancement might involve a combination of maximal explosive intent training with heavier loads and plyometric exercises with lighter loads at high velocities. This narrative review synthesizes key literature to answer whether contraction intent or movement speed is more critical for athletic performance enhancement, ultimately advocating for an integrative approach to resistance training tailored for sports-specific explosive action.},

A total of 366 respondents (n = 134 male and n = 232 female), all aged over 20 years, reported considerable training experience, with 55\% of the males and 42\% of the females reporting 5+ years of experience. The data were analyzed and reported descriptively with differences {$>$}5\% identified based on the use of a 5-point Likert scale, the sample size, and the nature of the observations. Disparities between the males and females were identified; the males reported higher perceptions of managing effort, technique, and programming without supervision compared to the females. Safety was noted as being more important to the females compared to the males. Qualitatively, additional themes were raised including an analogy of the personal relationship between the trainer and trainee being similar to that between medical professionals and patients. This was validated where the participants discussed their adaptations from supervised strength training for maintaining quality of life in aging and recovering from medical conditions and injury. The data are discussed in the context of a previous body of literature suggesting males falsely report higher levels of confidence in tasks compared to females, particularly in relation to effort, role models, and verbal encouragement. We posit that the greater confidence expressed by males at least partially explains the greater engagement in strength training practices by males compared to females, as well as explaining the higher level of participation in supervised strength training by females compared to males. This research proves beneficial for strength training practitioners in enhancing their understanding and expectations of clients, as well as hopefully proving insightful in engaging more people in strength training.},

Thirty-six young men and women were randomly assigned to one of two experimental, parallel groups to complete an 8-week RT programme: One group received direct supervision for their RT sessions (SUP); the other group performed the same RT programme in an unsupervised manner (UNSUP). Programme variables were kept constant between groups. We obtained pre- and post-study assessments of body composition via multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), muscle thickness of the upper and lower limbs via ultrasound, 1 repetition maximum (RM) in the back squat and bench press, isometric knee extension strength, and countermovement jump (CMJ) height. Results showed the SUP group generally achieved larger increases in muscle thickness for the triceps brachii, all sites of the rectus femoris, and the proximal region of the vastus lateralis. MF-BIA indicated increases in lean mass favoured SUP. Squat 1RM was greater for SUP; bench press 1RM and isometric knee extension were similar between conditions. CMJ increases modestly favoured UNSUP. In conclusion, our findings suggest that supervised RT promotes greater muscular adaptations and enhances exercise adherence in young, resistance-trained individuals.},

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for performance/ functional outcomes and/or body composition measurements. Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Resistance training has well-documented health benefits; however, participation and adherence remain overwhelmingly low. Supervision has been evidenced to improve adherence, and produce favourable adaptations compared to unsupervised resistance training. A recent exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis on supervision during resistance training noted a lack of clarity as to the purpose/intent of the supervisor within the body of literature. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in English and distributed primarily across social media platforms and through the authors' personal and professional networks. The aim of the survey was to compare the perceptions of supervision between trainers and trainees. Secondary outcomes included exploratory analyses of the impact of training experience, sex of participant, and comparison based on supervision type. Results: 468 participants completed all elements of the survey (68\% male, 32\% female). Of which 236 were personal trainers/strength coaches, and 232 were trainees. In brief, descriptive data from the survey suggest that trainers perceived supervision as more important than trainees for the characteristics and variables measured. Females perceived supervision in resistance training as more important than males. Trainees who engage in supervised resistance training reported supervision to be more important compared to those training alone or with a training partner. Technical coaching was reported to be the most important characteristic of supervision. Finally, trainers and trainees engaging in supervised strength training reported lower injury rates compared to those strength training unsupervised or with a training partner. Qualitative data are presented regarding perceptions of how and why supervision should differ based on sex, age, and experience, as well as reporting injury experiences. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the perceived benefits of supervision vary based on population. We posit that the present data have implications for both trainers and trainees, which might serve to strengthen a relationship by aligning roles and realising goals in supervised resistance training. Further, this data might provide insight and prompt future research as to how to engage more people into resistance training.},

However, to date, there has been a lack of clarity within the terminology used, as well as when considering the differences between supervision and facilitation, and connections between supervision, feedback and attentional focus. Multiple articles have identified a lack of transparency in previous research and a need for greater detail on key elements which form the basis of supervision. The aim of this review is to discuss supervision as a construct within the parameters of strength training, including differentiating characteristics along a spectrum from supervision to facilitation, the use of different mediums (one-to-one, small group and virtual) and the effects of internal feedback (including perceptions and measures of effort), external feedback (including contemporary technological approaches) and attentional focus, and augmented feedback upon performance outcome measures. Finally, this review discusses the possible importance of positive feedback within supervision and the position of personal training and strength coaching as a service industry, as well as providing context around autonomy and input on the part of the trainee. In context, this paper provides guidance for future researchers about presenting clarity and detail of supervision and feedback, while also providing practitioners with information to stimulate awareness in coaching practices.},

Purpose:~           Overtraining  is primarily related to sustained high load training, often coupled with other stressors.  Studies in animal models have suggested that unremittingly heavy training (monotonous  training) may increase the likelihood of developing overtraining syndrome. The purpose  of this study was to extend our preliminary observations by relating the incidence  of illnesses and minor injuries to various indices of training.           Methods:~           We  report observations of the relationship of banal illnesses (a frequently cited marker  of overtraining syndrome) to training load and training monotony in experienced athletes (N = 25). Athletes recorded their training using a method that integrates  the exercise session RPE and the duration of the training session. Illnesses were  noted and correlated with indices of training load (rolling 6 wk average), monotony (daily mean/standard deviation), and strain (load * monotony).           Results:~           It  was observed that a high percentage of illnesses could be accounted for when individual  athletes exceeded individually identifiable training thresholds, mostly related to  the strain of training.           Conclusions:~           These results suggest  that simple methods of monitoring the characteristics of training may allow the athlete  to achieve the goals of training while minimizing undesired training outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Several retrospective studies of strength sport athletes have reported strength adaptations over months to years; however, such adaptations are not linear. METHODS: We explored changes in strength over time in a large, retrospective sample of powerlifting (PL) athletes. Specifically, we examined the rate and magnitude of strength adaptation based on age category and weight class for PL competition total, and the squat, bench press, and deadlift, respectively. Mixed effects growth modelling was performed for each operationalised performance outcome (squat, bench press, deadlift, and total) as the dependent variables, with outcomes presented on both the raw, untransformed time scale and on the common logarithmic scale. Additionally, the fitted values were rescaled as a percentage. RESULTS: Collectively, the greatest strength gains were in the earliest phase of PL participation ({\textasciitilde}\,7.5-12.5\% increase in the first year, and up to an\,{\textasciitilde}\,20\% increase after 10~years). Females tended to display faster progression, possibly because of lower baseline strength. Additionally, female Masters 3 and 4 athletes ({$>$}\,59~years) still displayed\,{\textasciitilde}\,2.5-5.0\% strength improvement, but a slight strength loss was observed in Masters 4 ({$>$}\,69~years) males ({\textasciitilde}\,0.35\%/year). CONCLUSION: Although directly applicable to PL, these findings provide population-level support for the role of consistent and continued strength training to improve strength across the age span and, importantly, to mitigate, or at least largely attenuate age-related declines in strength compared to established general population norms. This information should be used to encourage participation in strength sports, resistance training more generally, and to support future public health messaging.},

This has the advantage that selection bias and confounding due to between-group differences are limited. However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study.

Although all but one study was undertaken within health sciences, study methods, contexts, and findings were highly heterogeneous. Most studies reported some evidence of an effect, although significant biases are judged likely because of the complexity of the evaluation object.

The current REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship is based on few studies and has not incorporated uncertainty into estimations or accounted for between-individuals variation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-regression to estimate the mean and between-individuals standard deviation of the number of repetitions that can be completed at various percentages of 1RM. We also explored if the REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship is moderated by sex, age, training status, and/or exercise. A total of 952 repetitions-to-failure tests, completed by 7289 individuals in 452 groups from 269 studies, were identified. Study groups were predominantly male (66\%), healthy (97\%),\,{$<$}\,59~years of age (92\%), and resistance trained (60\%). The bench press (42\%) and leg press (14\%) were the most commonly studied exercises. The REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship for mean repetitions and standard deviation of repetitions were best described using natural cubic splines and a linear model, respectively, with mean and standard deviation for repetitions decreasing with increasing \%1RM. More repetitions were evident in the leg press than bench press across the loading spectrum, thus separate REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM tables were developed for these two exercises. Analysis of moderators suggested little influences of sex, age, or training status on the REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship, thus the general main model REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM table can be applied to all individuals and to all exercises other than the bench press and leg press.

Resistance-trained males (n = 12) and females (n = 6) completed an 8-week intervention involving two RT sessions per week. The lower limbs of each participant were randomised to perform the leg press and leg extension exercises either to (i) momentary muscular failure (FAIL) or (ii) a perceived 2-RIR and 1-RIR, respectively, for the entire intervention. In weeks one, four, and eight, post-set ratings of perceived discomfort (RPD), and post-session ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and general feelings via feeling scale (FS) were measured. Data were analysed with Bayesian mixed-effect models. When averaged over all time points measured, results showed slightly greater RPD for FAIL [5.1 (HDI: 4.2--6.0); pd = 100\%] versus RIR [4.1 (HDI: 3.2--5.1); pd = 100\%], greater RPE for FAIL [5.4 (HDI: 4.6--6.3); pd = 100\%] versus RIR [4.3 (HDI: 3.5--5.1); pd = 100\%], and more positive general feelings for RIR [1.2 (HDI: 0.7--1.8); pd = 100\%] versus FAIL [0.3 (HDI: -0.3 to 0.8); pd = 86\%]. Overall, assessing perceptual responses may help inform RIR prescription to promote desired outcomes whilst limiting negative feelings that may compromise long-term adherence.},

  abstract = {While proximity-to-failure is considered an important resistance training (RT) prescription variable, its influence on physiological adaptations and short-term responses to RT is uncertain. Given the ambiguity in the literature, a scoping review was undertaken to summarise evidence for the influence of proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy, neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage and perceived discomfort. Literature searching was performed according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines and identified three themes of studies comparing either: i) RT performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure, ii) RT performed to set failure (defined as anything other than momentary muscular failure) versus non-failure, and iii) RT performed to different velocity loss thresholds. The findings highlight that no consensus definition for "failure" exists in the literature, and the proximity-to-failure achieved in "non-failure" conditions is often ambiguous and variable across studies. This poses challenges when deriving practical recommendations for manipulating proximity-to-failure in RT to achieve desired outcomes. Based on the limited available evidence, RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT for inducing muscle hypertrophy, but may exacerbate neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and post-set perceived discomfort versus non-failure RT. Together, these factors may impair post-exercise recovery and subsequent performance, and may also negatively influence long-term adherence to RT.KEY POINTS This scoping review identified three broad themes of studies investigating proximity-to-failure in RT, based on the specific definition of set failure used (and therefore the research question being examined), to improve the validity of study comparisons and interpretations.There is no consensus definition for set failure in RT, and the proximity-to-failure achieved during non-failure RT is often unclear and varies both within and between studies, which together poses challenges when interpreting study findings and deriving practical recommendations regarding the influence of RT proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy and other short-term responses.Based on the limited available evidence, performing RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT to maximise muscle hypertrophy, but the optimal proximity to failure in RT for muscle hypertrophy is unclear and may be moderated by other RT variables (e.g., load, volume-load). Also, RT performed to set failure likely induces greater neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and perceived discomfort than non-failure RT, which may negatively influence RT performance, post-RT recovery, and long-term adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined the influence of proximity-to-failure in resistance training (RT), using subjective repetitions-in-reserve (RIR) prediction, on neuromuscular fatigue and perceptual responses. METHODS: Twenty-four resistance-trained males (n\,=\,12) and females (n\,=\,12) completed three experimental trials in a randomised order, each involving six RT sets (barbell bench press) with 75\% 1-RM performed to either momentary muscular failure (FAIL), 1-RIR, or 3-RIR. Changes in lifting velocity with a fixed load were assessed from pre-exercise to post-exercise with the aim of quantifying acute neuromuscular fatigue (4 min post-exercise) and the associated time course of recovery (24 and 48 h post-exercise), and from the first to final set performed. Perceptual responses to RT were assessed at multiple time points during and following RT. RESULTS: Decreases in lifting velocity at 4 min post-exercise were greater for FAIL (\,-\,25\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,13\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,8\%), with greater decreases for male (\,-\,29\%) versus female (\,-\,21\%) participants following FAIL. At 24 h post-exercise, decreases in lifting velocity were greater for FAIL (\,-\,3\%) and 1-RIR (\,-\,3\%) versus 3-RIR (+\,2\%), with all between-protocol differences diminishing at 48 h post-exercise. Loss of lifting velocity from the first to final set was greater for FAIL (\,-\,22\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,9\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,6\%), with a greater lifting velocity loss from the first to final set for males (\,-\,15\%) versus females (\,-\,9\%). As proximity-to-failure neared, ratings of perceived discomfort, exertion, and muscle soreness increased, general feelings worsened, and perceived recovery decreased. CONCLUSION: These findings support a linear relationship between RT proximity-to-failure and both acute neuromuscular fatigue and negative perceptual responses, which may influence long-term physiological adaptations and adherence to RT.},

The aim of this study was to examine reliability of trainee ratings of perceived effort (RPE-E) and discomfort (RPE-D) using two novel scales in addition to reliability and validity of trainer RPE-E. Design: Participants underwent 3 RT trials over a period of three weeks. Methods: Seventeen participants (males n = 6, females n = 11, age 63 {\textpm} 16 years) completed 5 RT exercises for a single set using a load permitting a self-determined 6 repetition maximum (meaning they determined inability to complete further repetitions if attempted i.e. they predicted momentary failure on the next repetition). Trainers completed their rating of RPE-E, followed by participants reporting of RPE-E and RPE-D immediately after completion of the exercises. Spearman's correlations examined the relationship between RPE-E and RPE-D. Reliability was examined as standard error of measurement (SEM) calculated for each outcome across the 3 trials (intra-rater), in addition to agreement between trainers (inter-rater), and agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E. Results: Correlations between RPE-E and RPE-D were significant but weak (r = .373 to 0.492; p {$<$} 0.01). Intra-rater SEMs for trainee RPE-E ranged from 0.64 to 0.85, trainee RPE-D ranged from 0.60 to 1.00, and trainer RPE-E ranged from 0.56 to 0.71. Inter-rater SEMs for trainer RPE-E ranged 0.25 to 0.66. SEMs for agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E ranged from 1.03 to 1.25. Conclusions: Results suggest participants were able to differentiate RPE-E and RPE-D and that the reliability for both trainee measures of RPE-E and RPE-D, in addition to trainer RPE-E is acceptable. Further, trainer RPE-E appeared to have acceptable validity compared to trainee RPE-E. These scales might be adopted in research examining the dose-response nature of effort upon RT outcomes and trainers might use them to inform programming.},

  abstract = {It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally 'aerobic' (e.g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in 'muscle strengthening activities' though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.},

However, few studies have adequately examined the longitudinal time-course of strength adaptations to resistance training. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the time-course of strength development from minimal-dose resistance training in a large sample through retrospective training records from a private international exercise company. Methods: Data were available for analysis from 14,690 participants (60\% female; aged 48~{\textpm}~11~years) having undergone minimal-dose resistance training (1x/week, single sets to momentary failure of six exercises) up to 352~weeks ({\textasciitilde}6.8~years) in length. Linear-log growth models examined strength development over time allowing random intercepts and slopes by participant. Results: All models demonstrated a robust linear-log relationship with the first derivatives (i.e., changes in strength with time) trending asymptotically such that by {\textasciitilde}1-2~years strength had practically reached a "plateau." Sex, bodyweight, and age had minimal interaction effects. However, substantial strength gains were apparent; approximately {\textasciitilde}30-50\% gains over the first year reaching {\textasciitilde}50-60\% of baseline 6~years later. Conclusion: It is unclear if the "plateau" can be overcome through alternative approaches, or whether over the long-term strength gains differ. Considering this, our results support public health recommendations for minimal-dose resistance training for strength adaptations in adults.},

However, most research in the field focuses upon mean effects, particularly the effects of interventions to improve outcomes such as fitness or performance. It is thought that individual responses to interventions vary considerably. Hence, interest has increased in exploring precision or personalised exercise approaches. Not only is the mean often affected by interventions, but variation may also be impacted. Exploration of variation in studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can yield insight into interindividual heterogeneity in response to interventions and help determine generalisability of effects. Yet, larger samples sizes than those used for typical mean effects are required when probing variation. Thus, in a field with small samples such as sport and exercise science, exploration of variation through a meta-analytic framework is appealing. Despite the value of embracing and exploring variation alongside mean effects in sport and exercise science, it is rarely applied to research synthesis through meta-analysis. We introduce and evaluate different effect size calculations along with models for meta-analysis of variation using relatable examples from resistance training RCTs.},

The purpose of this article is to consider and define `effort' during attempted task performance. In doing so I argue for distinction between the actual effort (objective effort) required, and the perception of that effort (subjective effort), during intentionally attempted task performance. I adopt a set theoretical approach to defining the intensional concepts, and extensional phenomenal constructs, and employ the tradition of Theory-Theory to illustrate tentative causal theories for and relating the concepts. The definitions I propose are deliberately agnostic of the specific task demands being attempted (e.g. physical, cognitive, self-control, or a combination) and thus reflect `general' definitions of effort and its perception. Throughout, I draw upon and synthesise literature from across a multitude of disciplines, combining empirical evidence with armchair philosophising, and offer what insights I have from my own experience both as someone experiencing `effort', and as a third-person observer investigating it. This work is intended to, at the very least, make my own current pretheoretical conceptualisation and understanding of `effort' transparent to other researchers, and aid interpretation of subsequent empirical work, theory building, and theory testing on the topic. Further, I hope it might be useful to researchers across various fields, unify paradigms and help with integration of learnings across disciplines, and further understanding of the role of `effort' and its perception from a broad scientific perspective.},

  abstract = {Hypertrophy and strength are two common long-term goals of resistance training that are mediated by the manipulation of numerous variables. One training variable that is often neglected but is essential to consider for achieving strength and hypertrophy gains is the movement tempo of particular repetitions. Although research has extensively investigated the effects of different intensities, volumes, and rest intervals on muscle growth, many of the present hypertrophy guidelines do not account for different movement tempos, likely only applying to volitional movement tempos. Changing the movement tempo during the eccentric and concentric phases can influence acute exercise variables, which form the basis for chronic adaptive changes to resistance training. To further elaborate on the already unclear anecdotal evidence of different movement tempos on muscle hypertrophy and strength development, one must acknowledge that the related scientific research does not provide equivocal evidence. Furthermore, there has been no assessment of the impact of duration of particular movement phases (eccentric vs. concentric) on chronic adaptations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions in terms of resistance-training recommendations. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to explain how variations in movement tempo can affect chronic adaptive changes. This article provides an overview of the available scientific data describing the impact of movement tempo on hypertrophy and strength development with a thorough analysis of changes in duration of particular phases of movement.
