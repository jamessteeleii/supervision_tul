  abstract = {A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 1322 members of a 1-on-1 personalized strength training studio. A total of 366 respondents (n = 134 male and n = 232 female), all aged over 20 years, reported considerable training experience, with 55\% of the males and 42\% of the females reporting 5+ years of experience. The data were analyzed and reported descriptively with differences {$>$}5\% identified based on the use of a 5-point Likert scale, the sample size, and the nature of the observations. Disparities between the males and females were identified; the males reported higher perceptions of managing effort, technique, and programming without supervision compared to the females. Safety was noted as being more important to the females compared to the males. Qualitatively, additional themes were raised including an analogy of the personal relationship between the trainer and trainee being similar to that between medical professionals and patients. This was validated where the participants discussed their adaptations from supervised strength training for maintaining quality of life in aging and recovering from medical conditions and injury. The data are discussed in the context of a previous body of literature suggesting males falsely report higher levels of confidence in tasks compared to females, particularly in relation to effort, role models, and verbal encouragement. We posit that the greater confidence expressed by males at least partially explains the greater engagement in strength training practices by males compared to females, as well as explaining the higher level of participation in supervised strength training by females compared to males. This research proves beneficial for strength training practitioners in enhancing their understanding and expectations of clients, as well as hopefully proving insightful in engaging more people in strength training.},

  abstract = {This study compared the effects of supervised versus unsupervised resistance training (RT) on measures of muscle strength and hypertrophy in resistance-trained individuals. Thirty-six young men and women were randomly assigned to one of two experimental, parallel groups to complete an 8-week RT programme: One group received direct supervision for their RT sessions (SUP); the other group performed the same RT programme in an unsupervised manner (UNSUP). Programme variables were kept constant between groups. We obtained pre- and post-study assessments of body composition via multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), muscle thickness of the upper and lower limbs via ultrasound, 1 repetition maximum (RM) in the back squat and bench press, isometric knee extension strength, and countermovement jump (CMJ) height. Results showed the SUP group generally achieved larger increases in muscle thickness for the triceps brachii, all sites of the rectus femoris, and the proximal region of the vastus lateralis. MF-BIA indicated increases in lean mass favoured SUP. Squat 1RM was greater for SUP; bench press 1RM and isometric knee extension were similar between conditions. CMJ increases modestly favoured UNSUP. In conclusion, our findings suggest that supervised RT promotes greater muscular adaptations and enhances exercise adherence in young, resistance-trained individuals.},

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for performance/ functional outcomes and/or body composition measurements. Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Resistance training has well-documented health benefits; however, participation and adherence remain overwhelmingly low. Supervision has been evidenced to improve adherence, and produce favourable adaptations compared to unsupervised resistance training. A recent exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis on supervision during resistance training noted a lack of clarity as to the purpose/intent of the supervisor within the body of literature. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in English and distributed primarily across social media platforms and through the authors' personal and professional networks. The aim of the survey was to compare the perceptions of supervision between trainers and trainees. Secondary outcomes included exploratory analyses of the impact of training experience, sex of participant, and comparison based on supervision type. Results: 468 participants completed all elements of the survey (68\% male, 32\% female). Of which 236 were personal trainers/strength coaches, and 232 were trainees. In brief, descriptive data from the survey suggest that trainers perceived supervision as more important than trainees for the characteristics and variables measured. Females perceived supervision in resistance training as more important than males. Trainees who engage in supervised resistance training reported supervision to be more important compared to those training alone or with a training partner. Technical coaching was reported to be the most important characteristic of supervision. Finally, trainers and trainees engaging in supervised strength training reported lower injury rates compared to those strength training unsupervised or with a training partner. Qualitative data are presented regarding perceptions of how and why supervision should differ based on sex, age, and experience, as well as reporting injury experiences. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the perceived benefits of supervision vary based on population. We posit that the present data have implications for both trainers and trainees, which might serve to strengthen a relationship by aligning roles and realising goals in supervised resistance training. Further, this data might provide insight and prompt future research as to how to engage more people into resistance training.},

The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014, European Economic Review 72, 52--75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe.

The current REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship is based on few studies and has not incorporated uncertainty into estimations or accounted for between-individuals variation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-regression to estimate the mean and between-individuals standard deviation of the number of repetitions that can be completed at various percentages of 1RM. We also explored if the REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship is moderated by sex, age, training status, and/or exercise. A total of 952 repetitions-to-failure tests, completed by 7289 individuals in 452 groups from 269 studies, were identified. Study groups were predominantly male (66\%), healthy (97\%),\,{$<$}\,59~years of age (92\%), and resistance trained (60\%). The bench press (42\%) and leg press (14\%) were the most commonly studied exercises. The REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship for mean repetitions and standard deviation of repetitions were best described using natural cubic splines and a linear model, respectively, with mean and standard deviation for repetitions decreasing with increasing \%1RM. More repetitions were evident in the leg press than bench press across the loading spectrum, thus separate REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM tables were developed for these two exercises. Analysis of moderators suggested little influences of sex, age, or training status on the REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM relationship, thus the general main model REPS\,{\textasciitilde}\,\%1RM table can be applied to all individuals and to all exercises other than the bench press and leg press.

  abstract = {While proximity-to-failure is considered an important resistance training (RT) prescription variable, its influence on physiological adaptations and short-term responses to RT is uncertain. Given the ambiguity in the literature, a scoping review was undertaken to summarise evidence for the influence of proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy, neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage and perceived discomfort. Literature searching was performed according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines and identified three themes of studies comparing either: i) RT performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure, ii) RT performed to set failure (defined as anything other than momentary muscular failure) versus non-failure, and iii) RT performed to different velocity loss thresholds. The findings highlight that no consensus definition for "failure" exists in the literature, and the proximity-to-failure achieved in "non-failure" conditions is often ambiguous and variable across studies. This poses challenges when deriving practical recommendations for manipulating proximity-to-failure in RT to achieve desired outcomes. Based on the limited available evidence, RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT for inducing muscle hypertrophy, but may exacerbate neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and post-set perceived discomfort versus non-failure RT. Together, these factors may impair post-exercise recovery and subsequent performance, and may also negatively influence long-term adherence to RT.KEY POINTS This scoping review identified three broad themes of studies investigating proximity-to-failure in RT, based on the specific definition of set failure used (and therefore the research question being examined), to improve the validity of study comparisons and interpretations.There is no consensus definition for set failure in RT, and the proximity-to-failure achieved during non-failure RT is often unclear and varies both within and between studies, which together poses challenges when interpreting study findings and deriving practical recommendations regarding the influence of RT proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy and other short-term responses.Based on the limited available evidence, performing RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT to maximise muscle hypertrophy, but the optimal proximity to failure in RT for muscle hypertrophy is unclear and may be moderated by other RT variables (e.g., load, volume-load). Also, RT performed to set failure likely induces greater neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and perceived discomfort than non-failure RT, which may negatively influence RT performance, post-RT recovery, and long-term adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined the influence of proximity-to-failure in resistance training (RT), using subjective repetitions-in-reserve (RIR) prediction, on neuromuscular fatigue and perceptual responses. METHODS: Twenty-four resistance-trained males (n\,=\,12) and females (n\,=\,12) completed three experimental trials in a randomised order, each involving six RT sets (barbell bench press) with 75\% 1-RM performed to either momentary muscular failure (FAIL), 1-RIR, or 3-RIR. Changes in lifting velocity with a fixed load were assessed from pre-exercise to post-exercise with the aim of quantifying acute neuromuscular fatigue (4 min post-exercise) and the associated time course of recovery (24 and 48 h post-exercise), and from the first to final set performed. Perceptual responses to RT were assessed at multiple time points during and following RT. RESULTS: Decreases in lifting velocity at 4 min post-exercise were greater for FAIL (\,-\,25\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,13\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,8\%), with greater decreases for male (\,-\,29\%) versus female (\,-\,21\%) participants following FAIL. At 24 h post-exercise, decreases in lifting velocity were greater for FAIL (\,-\,3\%) and 1-RIR (\,-\,3\%) versus 3-RIR (+\,2\%), with all between-protocol differences diminishing at 48 h post-exercise. Loss of lifting velocity from the first to final set was greater for FAIL (\,-\,22\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,9\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,6\%), with a greater lifting velocity loss from the first to final set for males (\,-\,15\%) versus females (\,-\,9\%). As proximity-to-failure neared, ratings of perceived discomfort, exertion, and muscle soreness increased, general feelings worsened, and perceived recovery decreased. CONCLUSION: These findings support a linear relationship between RT proximity-to-failure and both acute neuromuscular fatigue and negative perceptual responses, which may influence long-term physiological adaptations and adherence to RT.},

The aim of this study was to examine reliability of trainee ratings of perceived effort (RPE-E) and discomfort (RPE-D) using two novel scales in addition to reliability and validity of trainer RPE-E. Design: Participants underwent 3 RT trials over a period of three weeks. Methods: Seventeen participants (males n = 6, females n = 11, age 63 {\textpm} 16 years) completed 5 RT exercises for a single set using a load permitting a self-determined 6 repetition maximum (meaning they determined inability to complete further repetitions if attempted i.e. they predicted momentary failure on the next repetition). Trainers completed their rating of RPE-E, followed by participants reporting of RPE-E and RPE-D immediately after completion of the exercises. Spearman's correlations examined the relationship between RPE-E and RPE-D. Reliability was examined as standard error of measurement (SEM) calculated for each outcome across the 3 trials (intra-rater), in addition to agreement between trainers (inter-rater), and agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E. Results: Correlations between RPE-E and RPE-D were significant but weak (r = .373 to 0.492; p {$<$} 0.01). Intra-rater SEMs for trainee RPE-E ranged from 0.64 to 0.85, trainee RPE-D ranged from 0.60 to 1.00, and trainer RPE-E ranged from 0.56 to 0.71. Inter-rater SEMs for trainer RPE-E ranged 0.25 to 0.66. SEMs for agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E ranged from 1.03 to 1.25. Conclusions: Results suggest participants were able to differentiate RPE-E and RPE-D and that the reliability for both trainee measures of RPE-E and RPE-D, in addition to trainer RPE-E is acceptable. Further, trainer RPE-E appeared to have acceptable validity compared to trainee RPE-E. These scales might be adopted in research examining the dose-response nature of effort upon RT outcomes and trainers might use them to inform programming.},

  abstract = {It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally 'aerobic' (e.g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in 'muscle strengthening activities' though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.},

  abstract = {Despite its apparent intuitiveness and widespread interest across various fields, `effort' is a concept that seems difficult to define. The purpose of this article is to consider and define `effort' during attempted task performance. In doing so I argue for distinction between the actual effort (objective effort) required, and the perception of that effort (subjective effort), during intentionally attempted task performance. I adopt a set theoretical approach to defining the intensional concepts, and extensional phenomenal constructs, and employ the tradition of Theory-Theory to illustrate tentative causal theories for and relating the concepts. The definitions I propose are deliberately agnostic of the specific task demands being attempted (e.g. physical, cognitive, self-control, or a combination) and thus reflect `general' definitions of effort and its perception. Throughout, I draw upon and synthesise literature from across a multitude of disciplines, combining empirical evidence with armchair philosophising, and offer what insights I have from my own experience both as someone experiencing `effort', and as a third-person observer investigating it. This work is intended to, at the very least, make my own current pretheoretical conceptualisation and understanding of `effort' transparent to other researchers, and aid interpretation of subsequent empirical work, theory building, and theory testing on the topic. Further, I hope it might be useful to researchers across various fields, unify paradigms and help with integration of learnings across disciplines, and further understanding of the role of `effort' and its perception from a broad scientific perspective.},
